# Pierre Véron's CV Assistant

This project is an AI-powered chat application that allows users to interact with an assistant knowledgeable about Pierre Véron's skills and experience. It's built with Next.js and uses [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) models for the chat functionality.

## How to Use

1. Visit the application at [https://mistralai-chat-app.vercel.app](https://mistralai-chat-app.vercel.app)

2. On the sidebar, you'll see an input field for the Mistral API key. Enter your Mistral API key here and click "Save".

3. Once the API key is saved, you can start a new conversation by typing your question in the chat input at the bottom of the screen.

4. Ask questions about Pierre's experience, skills, or any other relevant information. Some example questions you can ask:
   - "Why is Pierre a great fit for Mistral?"
   - "Tell me about Pierre's experience with AI"
   - "Where can I find more of Pierre's projects?"

5. The AI assistant will respond with information based on Pierre's CV and experience.

## Note
